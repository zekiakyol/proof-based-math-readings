# Motivation 

- *Proof-Based Math Readings* is a free and independent online reading group where we study mathematics required in economics master's/PhD programs using an intuitive approach.
- This session of the reading group is on *Proof Techniques*.

# Prerequisites

- CGPA: 3.00/4.00.
- Please use the [\faLink Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3OxwYuAwiDXMVTCQ_x3FTtKnHmRRkl_SXlpdfqTDty06PxQ/viewform) to join our reading group.
- Applicants are informed about their application results within a week via email.

# Format

- This session takes 12 weeks.
- We discuss the topics/exercises that we struggle with at [\faDiscord Proof-Based Math Readings \[Discord\]](https://discord.com).
- We do not have face-to-face/online meetings due to the size of the group.
- Members are expected to read the chapters, and watch the chapter videos from the book's playlist.

# Resources [All are open-access]

## Main Book and Main Book's Playlist

**Book of Proof (3.3 Edition, 2022)** by Richard Hammack is our main book because it is a well-written and well-structured pedagogical masterpiece. It is also open-access and provides detailed solutions for odd-numbered exercises at the end of the book.

Jeremy Teitelbaum's playlist on Book of Proof is our main playlist because his narrative is just great.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\faBook] \href{https://richardhammack.github.io/BookOfProof/}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022)}
  \item[\faYoutube] \href{https://www.youtube.com/@jeremy9959/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022, Playlist by Jeremy Teitelbaum, Chapters 1-12)}
\end{itemize}

## Supplementary

### Proof

In case we need to watch a proof topic from another instructor, we have two additional playlists.

Because our main playlist does not cover Chapters 13-14, we cover these chapters from Michael Penn's playlist.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\faYoutube] \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1x00m7Oo9XzEkDDACeEK_m-}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022, Playlist by Michael Penn, Chapters 1-14)}

\end{itemize}

### Calculus

In case we need to remember a topic from calculus, we can use these resources.

\begin{itemize}

# Reading Schedule

I recommend the following study routine below: 

1) First read a chapter from the book, then watch the playlist of the chapter
2) Solve odd-numbered exercises and check their solutions at the end of the book.
3) Solve even-numbered exercises and check their solutions from our unofficial solutions manual.
4) If you cannot solve/understand an exercise, discuss the exercise in our Discord.
5) Move on to the next chapter of the book
