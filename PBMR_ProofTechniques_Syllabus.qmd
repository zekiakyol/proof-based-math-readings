# Motivation 

  - *Proof-Based Math Readings* is a free and independent online reading group where we study mathematics required in economics master's/PhD programs using an intuitive approach.
  - This session of the reading group is on *Proof Techniques*.

# Prerequisites

  - CGPA: 3.00/4.00
  - Please use our [\faLink Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3OxwYuAwiDXMVTCQ_x3FTtKnHmRRkl_SXlpdfqTDty06PxQ/viewform) to join our reading group anytime.
  - People who applied will be informed about their application results within a week.

# Format

  - This session will last 6 weeks from 12 June 2023 to 23 July 2023.
  - We will discuss the topics/exercises that we struggle with at [\faDiscord Proof-Based Math Readings \[Discord\]](https://discord.com/).
  - We will not have face-to-face/online meetings due to size of the group.
  - Members are expected to read the chapters, and watch the chapter videos from the book's playlist.

# Resources [All are open-access]

## Main Book and Main Book's Playlist

**Book of Proof** by Richard Hammack is our main book because it is a well-written and well-structured pedagogical masterpiece. It is also open-access and provides detailed solutions for odd-numbered exercises at the end of the book.

Jeremy Teitelbaum's playlist on Book of Proof is our main playlist because his narrative is just great.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\faBook] \href{https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022)}
  \item[\faYoutube] \href{https://www.youtube.com/@jeremy9959/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=5}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022, Companion playlist by Jeremy Teitelbaum, Chapter 1-12)}
\end{itemize}

## Supplementary

### Proof

In case we need to watch a proof topic from another instructor, we have 2 additional companion playlists.  
Because our main playlist does not cover Chapter 13-14, we will cover theese chapters from Penn's playlist.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\faYoutube] \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1x00m7Oo9XzEkDDACeEK_m-}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022, Companion playlist by Michael Penn, Chapter 1-14)}

  \item[\faBook] \href{https://summit.plymouth.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.12774/381/psu-oer-024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}{Book of Proof - Richard Hammack (3.3 Edition, 2022, Companion workbook by Justin Wright)}
\end{itemize}

### Calculus

In case we need to remember a topic from calculus, we can use these playlists.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\faYoutube] \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr}{Essence of Calculus - 3Blue1Brown (2023)}

  \item[\faBook\faYoutube] \href{https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007}{Multi Variable Calculus - Denis Auroux (2007)}
  \item[\faCalculator] \href{https://www.geogebra.org/m/f08hfjvx}{Geogebra - Sequences and Series Calculator} and \href{https://www.geogebra.org/graphing}{Geogebra - Function Graph}
\end{itemize}

# Reading Schedule

I recommend this study routine:

  1) We read the chapter from the main book.
  2) We watch the main playlist of the chapter.
  3) We solve odd-numbered exercises and check their solutions at the end of the main book. 
  4) We solve even-numbered exercises in the main book.
  5) If we cannot solve/understand an exercise, we can discuss the exercise in our Discord server.
  6) We move on to the next chapter of the main book.
