# Proof-Based Math Readings

- **Proof-Based Math Readings** is an independent online reading group where we study mathematics required in economics master's/PhD programs using an intuitive approach.
- Our reading group has **22 members** and accepts new members before each session.
- Now, [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/zekiakyol/proof-based-math-readings/blob/main/PBMR_LinearAlgebra_Syllabus.pdf) session is available to apply.
- If you are admitted to one session, you do not have to apply for the other sessions.
