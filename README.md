# Proof-Based Math Readings

- **Proof-Based Math Readings** is an independent online reading group where we study mathematics required in economics master's/PhD programs using an intuitive approach.
- The reading group has 20 members and accepts new members before each session.
- Now, [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/zekiakyol/proof-based-math-readings/blob/main/PBMR_LinearAlgebra_Syllabus.pdf) session is available to apply.
